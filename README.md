## Summary

This manuscript presents a novel species distribution modeling framework that connects spatial and phylogenetic data to jointly estimate both environmental niches and their underlying evolutionary processes.

- The model is a **Bayesian hierarchical framework** that integrates species distribution modeling with phylogenetics.
- Environmental niches are estimated across species using a **latent Gaussian process**, linking **niche similarity to phylogenetic distance**.
- We connect the estimated model parameters to classical **evolutionary models** such as **Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck** and **Brownian Motion**, enabling specific hypothesis testing about niche evolution.
- Simulations demonstrate that the framework improves niche estimation across a clade, even when data is sparse or noisy.

## Installation

This analysis is lightweight in terms of package dependencies, as most functions required are written in base R (see `scripts/00-functions.R`).

You will need the following R packages:
```r
install.packages(c("rstan", "ape", "phytools", "terra", "MASS", "grDevices", "ggplot2"))
```

We also recommend using [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for reproducible environments. If available:
```r
renv::restore()
```

## Reproducing Results

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhi124081/nicheEvol_ms.git
cd nicheEvol_ms
```

### 2. Install R dependencies

As noted above, either manually install required packages or use `renv`.

### 3. Run simulations

You can replicate the simulations and model fitting pipeline using:

```r
source("scripts/00-functions.R")
source("scripts/02-gen_data.R")
source("scripts/03-stan_model.R")
source("scripts/04-run_file.R")
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All models were originally run on a High Performance Cluster using 8 CPUs. Running the full pipeline on a personal machine may be computationally intensive. Precomputed results are available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15090785).
